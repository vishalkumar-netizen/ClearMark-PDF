## 🧠 Hybrid Technology (How It Works)

ClearMark PDF uses a **dual-engine system**:

### 1️⃣ Structural Cleaning (Best Quality)

* Analyzes internal PDF structure
* Removes watermark objects directly
* Keeps original text selectable
* Maintains file quality

### 2️⃣ Visual Cleaning (Fallback Mode)

* Renders pages as images
* Detects light background watermark pixels
* Cleans watermark visually
* Works on nearly all PDFs

The application automatically chooses the best method for each uploaded file.
